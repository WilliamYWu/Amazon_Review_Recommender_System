that this is the dairy industrys number one claim to fame schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is gd for bones but he blatantly dismies them one study shows that asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than westerners even though they consume le dairy schwarcz responds by saying true enough but they also have a very dierent overa diet and lifestyle he leaves it at that and he doesnt bother to say what parts of the very dierent diet and lifestyle are healthier he then mentions the comprehensive nurses health study which found that nurses who drank two or more glaes of milk a day actuay broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with i say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it to make things worse schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who criticizes milk consumption as part of the antimilk loy driven more by an iational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence i eat moderate amounts of dairy for taste not health and im not part of any antimilk loy but does that mean i must believe that dairy fds are gd for my bones schwarcz says that when we lk at the totality of the evidence an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake and dairy products oer the best source of calcium schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength which in eect means he is suesting that dairy is gd for bones but again he doesnt oer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim and instead shows us two studies which contradict it furthermore schwarcz dismies antimilk arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning hes miing the entire point the objective and teing observation that a adult animals on earth thrive without milk schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human

greater depth on fewer subjects the ones he was most knowledgeable on dairy fds are not one of these subjects and his bias in their favor is painfuy obvious  he portrays the antidairy segment of our

acknowledges that milk stands aused of contributing to heart disease stroke breast cancer prostate cancer ovarian cancer diabetes aergies stomach cramps diahea autism mucus production and get this bone fractures  he fails to acknowledge the theory thats becoming more widely aepted within the nutritional science counity for why cows milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health  that the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the bld puing calcium from the bones to maintain a stable ph level and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body  he continues but milk is also linkedwith reducing heart disease breast cancer colorectal cancer and of course bone fracture  the antimilk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning  again he neglects to mention the rest of the story that in nature no other species would ever consume the breast milk of another species regardle of stage of life thats hardly a compeing argument no other species designs airplanes develops antibiotics or bakes bread either  he tries to refute the nurses health study by suesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk were doing so not because they liked it but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition andor other risk factors for osteoporosis and believed consuming more cows milk would help them so to his way of thinking drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overa greater osteoporotic risk in general therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hipfracture sn in the nurses health study as the extra milk was poibly beneficial but just not beneficial enough to overcome the higherrisks within this selfselected subgroup while the lead author of this study may lend some suort for that hypothesis her coauthor dr walter wie does not  in this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a trace of dioxin he acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem but suests we eat lowfat dairy and limit saturated fats from elsewhere  he doesnt get into the tumorpromoting properties of casein the primary milk protein likewise he stays right away from the whole raw milk iue or movement and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization theres no discuion on grafed as oosed to grainfed cows or any iues relating to factory farming although he does give brief mention to insulinlike growth factor  most people who know anything about nutrition know that 2 cows milk actuay contains over 30 of calories from fat the dairy industry likes to mislead and deceive the public by measuring water weight rather than counting calories  this author pus a similar stunt with calcium he boasts a gla of milk contains about 3 miigrams of calcium a cup of yogurt 4 by comparison the best vegetable source is brooli with about 1 miigrams per cup  of course hes not only wrong about brooli being the best vegetable source of calcium  bok choy and kale are both significantly higher  but he doesnt bother to mention that a cup of brooli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk and like other cruciferous vegetables brooli has a far superior nutrientprofile he does recoend brooli in a dierent part of the bk  there is some comic relief with the authors explanation for why large segments of the worlds population are lactose intolerant aarently the human species evolved hand in hf with the dairy cow but centuries ago the tsetse fly spread slping sickne throughout much of africa and asia decimating cale populations so not having ae to cows milk human populations over time lost much of their natural ability to make lactase the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion  while some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cows milk its important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store derived largely from grainfed cows pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production and antibiotics to ward o the sickne inherent to the animals living conditions  at least in most of the us  much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization and dairy fat today contains more dioxin and more environmental contaminates in general than any other fd north americans are likely to ingest  the author claims that while milk may not be a miracle fd it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet it auredly is not poison as suested by the likes of peta  websters

first publication order to be read first the internal chronology second  if one reads the history of narnia as strictly that one is much more likely to lose the truths lewis was trying to impart when one reads the lion if they had not read magicians nephew they wi be unaware of where the lamppost came lion is eential a story about edmond coming into the salvation of god it creates a real sense of

of the bk some things you might mi or not pay much aention to because you have already taken into aount in context of the storys chronology and not examined what lewis was trying to say through this

eustace then they can no longer go on and eustace and ji pole is in bk iv this is lost in the new order also you can s lewiss growth as a writer geing more and more realistic in characterization as each bk was wrien of course when he was writing these he was already a phenomenal writer but this provided rm for more growth and he developed his already great gift even more so  also as paul ford points out in his exceent companion to narnia the old order is reflective of biblical history gods people are in bondage to the egyptians and he frs them but the wine and groan and in the end many die in the wilderne then they go into babylon and hear a these creation stories after this they go and record their own history lewis after trying to write a creation story found he could not and went on teing other stories of narnia only after coming more and more into the spirit of the series after a gd deal of history had bn wrien could he go back and finish magician to quote the preface ford says the original order aows the reader to experience something experience something truer than even lewis intended the primordial neceity of paing first thru redemption then into a reinterpretation of ones own story and finay aowing the future to take its providence course and how true that is how many times can one understand what god is doing in your life until you come to know him when you come to the salvation and knowledge of christ after some time elapses you can go back and examine your life and can s where gods hand was on you guiding you to that place where you met christ and in so doing you come to trust god in a dper sense and as he tk care of your past he wi also take care of your future of course this was not intentional on lewiss part but it shows when god gives someone a gift that person can reach people in such a way as to be totay beyond the person and directly pointing to god this aspect truly points to jesus christ and the great emperor beyond the s  of course there is a balance they are stories and should be enjoyed as such through these stories lewis gives children and adults alike truth however if you overanalyze them you are losing the spirit of the

in narnia after the events in the silver chair when eustace scru and ji pole saved prince rilian from imprisonment and restored him to his father and the throne now rilians descendant king tirian enjoys the solitude of his hunting lodge with his best friend jewel the unicorn but there is treachery in narnia like nothing the country has ever faced before  a dishonest ape named shift has found a lionskin and forced pule the donkey to wear it now he lords over the talking beasts of the forest by pretending to be the mediator betwn them and the great lord aslan who remains hien in a stable and only emerges by the dim light of a campfire at night sn the game which began as a way for shift to obtain fd without any eort has goen dangerously out of control convinced that pule is the real aslan

bale is easily the most aegorical considering it is best described as narnias armageon to put it simply this is the end of narnia and dont think thats a spoiler as the very first sentence of this novel is in the last days of narnia and as such we have aegorical representations of the antichrist the false prophet the fate of nonbelievers heaven the final judgement the second coming and the end of the world its a prey hefty topic for a childrens novel and both the story and style of the bk is weightier than any previous bk in the series with plenty of death violence and tragedythis creates an interesting paradox overa considering the last bale is the most spiritual the most controversial the most disheartening and ultimately the most upbeat bk in the series  the calormenes are caed darkies throughout the story and are indisputably the viains what with their part to play in the destruction of narnia and the worship of their pagangod tash an element of one other bks in the series the horse and his boy that has raised ausations of racism yet lewis makes what is perhaps an aempt to compensate late in the novel by introducing a young calormene named emeth who is permied to enter aslans country based on his virtue even though he never believed nor foowed aslan in his lifetime a thought that may aeal to many though it does not exactly fit into christian teachings as always the authors dogma is a lile muled for in a of his bks lewis plays by his own rules by his own sense of right and wrong  this ranges from previous aacks on vegetarians and coed schls to his own opinions on who deserves salvation and who doesnt  this leads into the second major point of controversy within the bk the fate of susan pevensie the onetime qun of narnia to put it bluntly shes not here and her siblings dismi her as someone who is no longer a friend of narnia why what could have poibly caused her abandonment from narnia and aslan surely something truly teible we no actuay lewis pinpoints the cause as susans interest in nylons and lipstick and an interest in grownup things a beloved major character is excluded from the final instament of the series on the grounds of puberty what her fate becomes even more tragic when further information is revealed over the new situation of her siblings and parents readers wi know what im talking about and what it must mean for pr susan i was very

to beer things the last bale makes fantastic use of lewiss poetical prose and the bk caies a sense of both bierswtne and grandeur particularly in the chapter night fas on narnia though tirian is somewhat indistinguishable from caspian and rilian before him his friendship with jewel is iensely touching as is his relationship with the children who come to his aid far from the squaling duo in the silver chair ji and eustace acquit themselves exceently throughout the last bale reaching herostatus in their eorts to aid the faing narnia  the last bale is also lewis at his most philosophical perhaps its no coincidence that profeor kirke mentions plato as he explores metaphysics the boundaries of belief the relationship betwn the real and the unreal the existence of life after death and the nature of god himself in some ways the last bale is more akin to lewiss apologetic christian writings such as surprised by joy or mere christianity than any of the other narnian bks in that lewis uses it as a basis for many of his spiritual concepts and ideas as mentioned the last bale caies the most obvert christian meages particularly in a declaration lucy makes toward the end of the novel the stable dr which begins as a convenient holdingpen for the fake aslan sn takes on new theological meaning with a surprising symbolic coection to our own world  lewis makes exceent use of components introduced in his previous bks caing up the strange creatures and that ji and eustace discover in the silver chair the narnian concept of stars explored in the voyage of the dawn treader the magical transporting rings in the magicians nephew even the use of the phrase son of adam and daughter of eve that was used so long ago in the lion the witch and the wardrobe it a culminates in a wonderful

like wiiam mois and e nesbit both socialists so much for any notion of lewis the archreactionary and scenes from h rider haards lostworld adventures and perhaps glimpses of his souldevouring iortal beauties concepts from george macdonalds fairy tales for adults and children and images from arthur rackhams iustrations of wagner the voyage of the dawn treader sms to combine wiiam mois with the medieval irish the voyage of st brendan containing a mixture of idealized politics vivid realistic details and moral explications of strange events on increasingly exotic islands  it is a world in which jakob and wilhelm gri would have had to invent oral history instead of folklore the adventures of the brave lile tailor das tapfere schneiderlein of the grand boast s title of review almost might have taken place in some forgoen narnian borderland a world in which bahus is somehow a probably tipsy ay of father christmas and as lewis first intended it is perfectly natural for a faun to be walking through the winter wds with an armload of brownpaper parcels caying an umbrea wearing a wlen muler and trying to kp his tail out of the snow  and oh yes charging in as if on its own a version of basic christian stories and doctrines mostly in the form of aslan the lion son of the emperorbeyondthesea or over the sea and further variants  lewis was not overly concerned about consistent nomenclature or hyphenation among other lapses in method to which his old friend tolkien tk exception you can ca it aegory or symbolism but the bks are not strict aegories in the pilgrims progre mode we except for a few sections which can be read that way again consistency isnt the strongest point  it is aslan who lks out from the jacket of this harpercoins onevolume edition of a seven at one blow so to speak to the exclusion of a dense cast of humans sons of adam and daughters of eve talking beasts centaurs and nymphs dwarfs and underland gnomes surfacevisiting merpeople and dpdweing sea people dragons giants dryads maenads and many others plus some le iediately recognizable but memorable beings lewiss own creations notably the marshwiles or should that be marshwiles  note the aslan cover was also used for the trade paperback version of this omnibus so i didnt make a distinction on first reviewing the volume i have since noticed that recent printings of the trade paperback have a movietiein cover with the white witch  aractive but rather le aropriate for the whole series  narnia is only one of the lands visited in the course of the stories although it has a central place and with its neighbor and ay archenland is the only region for which we are given anything aroaching a history to be in a chronicle one ruing a the way from creation actuay before to apocalypse  urzeit und endzeit in the german phrase  especiay in the oicial rather than the publication order of the bks  the author wrote the seven novels in short chapters suitable for reading aloud he compared it to the discipline of writing soets and many younger children have encountered them in this way but the bks themselves were also intended to be lked at indd lewis insisted on picking the iustrator seling on the young woman who had briiantly iuminated tolkiens farmer giles of ham a few years before and despite a pose as a crusty old bachelor he sn found himself t enchanted by her to raise objections to her work when he reay wanted to he didnt like her exceively plain children or worse her lions  however many twn and tnagers and a lot of adults have found narnia enjoyable reading on their own the christian element is so unobtrusive that many readers have failed to notice it until it was pointed out although i continue to be surprised by the fact even if the lion the witch and the wardrobe didnt contain enough clues from the gospels surely the magicians nephew had enough from genesis if not so much from milton who dominated lewis 1943 science fiction novel perelandra to set o alarms then again how many people reay reay noticed or above a cared that the lion king is hamlet with animals  we i recognized the doctrinal side early on although i didnt think much about it for years not until i encountered some of the theology that lewis was drawing on buried in rw southerns the making of the mile ages and recognized with a start that the o soteriology in narnia might be preanselmian not lewiss original simplificationforchildren a maer worth aention only to those who dont nd it explained i aure you i wi return below to a consideration of the contents and what iues if any they pose  as for packaging alongside single volumes in hardcover mamarket and trade paperbacks and boxed sets of these there sm to be two omnibus editions of the chronicles of narnia cuently available one is this 8page monolith including an eay by the author from 24 and the other is the complete chronicles of narnia published in 18 which is a mere 528 pages and i am not quite sure which of the poible markets for the stories either of the omnibuses is aimed at although having seven titles neatly bundled together does sound gd and one thick bk probably lks far le childish  indd without the jacket the 24 edition lks more like a coege history text and a rather du one at that which perhaps goes along with the present editorial review description of this edition as for adults  in a sense of adult very concerned with being thought grown up of which lewis disaroved  the 24 version is mainly a straightforward compilation of the cuently standard texts established in 14 on the basis of the georey bles editions of the 1950s unfortunately discarding the revisions that lewis had made for the early american editions along with their prlyrendered art and some typographical eors blackandwhite art includes fupage frontispieces or iustrated title pages maps and sma chapter head iustrations those iustrations by pauline baynes which are included are restored to their original clarity  baynes own color art for the stories in the form of dustjackets is omied which is understandable more serious is the silent disaearance of the great many baynes iustrations from within the chapters with no reason gd or bad oered presumably it is to save space for those who like baynes work at least on the whole  lewis was right about it having strengths and weaknees this is a minus it would have bn nice not to say more truthful if the omiion was more clearly acknowledged if only for those who dont know that they exist of course some who know them may not mi them  the 18 complete version based on the same state of the text achieved its compreion of the aarent length by the use of double columns colored borders and colored renditions of a of pauline baynes original blackandwhite iustrations make that edition visuay aractive i am not sure that the eyeaeal would stand up we to prolonged reading and frankly i am not sure than even the 18 volume is sma enough to be childfriendly of course that is auming that someone wants to let a younger child handle its bright others might say gaudy pages  if one insists on colorized art it is available in other deluxe editions of the individual titles as we some with pauline baynes own dustjacket art used for the covers and no sign of textbkish columns of type these sm to me to be more truly userfriendly and there are editions with the blackandwhite art left as it was although rather badly reproduced in some instances i got the 1970s printings of the puin penguin paperbacks partly for the relatively clean reproduction of the art and have returned to them many times over the years comparing editions may be the only safe test  the adult plaing on reading aloud to one or more younger children from either of these omnibus editions may also want to ponder the diiculty of making clear that there are seven distinct stories and that one of them has bn completed even though there is a lot of the bk left in aition whether one is reading silently or aloud the option of foowing the original order instead of the chronological one is a bit more diicult when the laer is almost imposed by the binding they are here ordered as the magicians nephew 19 the lion the witch and the wardrobe 1950 the horse and his boy 1954 prince caspian 1951 the voyage of the dawn treader 1952 the silver chair 1953 and the last bale 1956 the horse and his boy was actuay wrien just before the silver chair and not surprisingly they share some shifts in lewis point of view also with magicians nephew and last bale which themselves share information not found in the now intervening bks where it would have bn relevant  of course if you are considering it for children the first thing to consider at a is whether to embark on such a reading  now leaving aside those who just dont enjoy them there are rival choruses of hostility to the narnia bks from those who object to any injection of christianity and from those who find its christian meage t lukewarm disguised and hoibly ecumenical and then there are those who think that it is actively pagan or satanic proving i suose that some things reay are in the eyes and hearts of readers those seriously interested in disputing lewis as a theologian  a legitimate concern  focus their aention on his explicit statements in readilyavailable bks like mere christianity although even there his striving to be broad church and his consciousne of history make him an easy target for those who want naower definitions  one o note among the objections is the claim that lewis celebrated war and violence in the stories a veteran of world war i in the trenches and almost a of his friends were dead by the end of it lewis makes it clear enough he thinks fighting a grim and unpleasant busine but  writing post1945 after making a first aempt in 1939  sometimes a neceary one  more plausible is the charge of sexism  which in fact is there although it moderates in the course of the series particularly if one foows the writingandpublication order rather than the internal chronology the silver chair the horse and his boy the magicians nephew and the last bale are rather dierent on this point from the earlierwrien volumes among which they have bn dispersed and the charge could be alied to almost a the literature of the past in narnia it is subtle enough that i doubt any child is going to be indoctrinated by it  particularly since lewis made an eort to portray overtly sexist males not that he would have caed them that as either flish or unpleasant and usuay both many of his unconscious aumptions and expreions sm a bit archaic but anyone wanting a bk that teaches girls to be properly girlish had beer lk elsewhere  some regard lewiss portrayal of the calormene empire the kingdom of narnias hostile neighbor as racist or antimuslim or both this deserves an eay in itself suice it to say that he went to some lengths to make it as pagan rather than muslim as poible although it does sm to reflect old european fears of the ooman empire of course if one insists on the resemblance it should be said that two of lewiss most aractive human characters are calormenes in a series in which

mismatched the covers are gorgeously printed but the interiors use very cheap pulp paper with bloy ink printing that obscures not only the text but the wonderful pauline baynes artwork since ma market paperbacks are routinely printed on pulp paper the problem here sms to be the prework the overinking of these pages obscures the printing of the text and obliterates the artwork since the one volume

redemption then into a reinterpretation of ones own story and finay aowing the future to take its providence courseand how true that ishow many times can one understand what god is doing in your life until you come to know himwhen you come to the salvation and knowledge of christ after some time elapses you can go back and examine your life and can s where gods hand was on you guiding you to that

and thou the traditional second person singular in english is thouththy the most exact way of translating tu from spanish is thou or th this was a bold experiment once the convention was understd and aepted one got used to and even grew to like it during the course of the novel many flashbacks and digreions take place as various characters te their stories and reminiscence about the past we learn for example that jordons grandfather was a civil war hero in the americas war of rebeion we also learned that his father was a coward and that he shot himself to death with a pistol it is indd ironic that hemingways own father coied suicide and that hemingway tk his own life with a shot gun many years later death is the primary focus of the novel with much discuion amongst the characters about what it is like to ki another human being was it the right thing to do and what would it be like to diein the end jordon is fatay wounded after suefuy completing his miion and trying to escape he

a straight rehash of wardrobe and is poibly the most forgeable of the narnia bks were it not for the introduction of caspian one of the major characters in the series it would almost certainly be the least memorable of the seven bks the children find themselves pued into a strange world this time by a magical force rather than by wandering through a wardrobe quickly and predictably enough the

dwarvesthis ispridethis is what it is like on earthwhat to us sms distasteful ifwe would reay let go of our pride and let god be god then in the end wewould have ultimate joythat is what lewis is saying thru the dwarves  lewis also uses claical philosophy to educate childrenthe oldnarnia is caed the shadowlands mere shadows of the more real heaventhis is straight from platothe values we hold dear such as truthvalour honour etc are manifestations of its eencewe practice truthand valourthat is a form of valour a shadowbut the eence ofvalour that is the real thing itselflewis uses this concept to help thechildren beer understand godi came acro this in this story when iwas a child i was astounded to realize it was plato when i was in aphilosophy cla in coegethat is why in being a christian the moreyou act like the christ the more christ is in you and part of youthemore honour you show and love you show the more christ is you and you arehim because christ is the very ultimate of honour and a the othervitures we hold dearthat is why god gave us the shadow of maiage tohelp us understand the very real union betwn god and manwe become onewith god just as man and woman become one flesh in sexual intercoursegod is such an awesome god  in the end we have a powerful vision ofheavenalthough it is narnia the ending he detailed was as much ourworld as narniahis prose is fantasticas far as c s lewiss merechristianity coming out in his fiction this is his ultimate achievementin giving hope to the christians on the afterlifethis is my favoritefrom the christian perspective of the narnia seriesthere is so much tolearn and digest from this beautiful bkthe heart of this achievementis that this is wrien for children and yet he packs so much meat into itwithout ever coming acro as condescending or preachytruly one of thebest  for adult fiction ti we have faces is his bestactuay ithink that novel is his dpest novel and his best  review 2the last bale the very last bk in the narnian chronicles also stands as the most impreive bk in the series as far as the religious aspect goes it also shows what l could have bn had lewis handled it properly lewis infuses christian ideology with fantasy for fantastic results and the result is a bk that stands as one of the most beautiful things he ever wrote there is no other prose from lewiss hand that equals the last sections of the last bale and the first sections of perelandra in terms of shr beauty and joy  in my own life the last bale has proven to be very significant because of lewiss utilization of the platonic concepts i did not know it was plato when i read lewis but when i tk a philosophy cla everything clicked and i consider myself a platonic christian this is lewiss prime aim in a seven bks of the chronicles of narnia lewis wants to provide in story form truths that because he has sown the sd when later encountered in adult life the children wi be much more sympathetic to them than they may otherwise be  another important theme ruing through the last bale is the use of perception and although we s it numerous times in the bks we s it here the most those who caot s the things of god blind themselves to it because of their own spiritual problems and the people wi not let go of their own sin to lead the life god wants them to lead in the great divorce this is the central theme of the bk people go on a bus ride to heaven and if they wish to stay they must give up a vice that they have retained only one makes the leap of faith and lets go of his red dragon which symbolises lust in the last bale the dwarfs wi not let themselves s the true beauty they would be in if they just aowed themselves the oortunity to s it  another thing about the last bale that troubles me is the presentation of emeth i have bn undecided on universalism as lewis presents it to be a radical universalist would simply not do and lewis was not i s the point he makes and there is a side of me that reay wants to believe what he has to say on emeth but another side of me balks at the idea i personay would never advocate this view simply because i simply dont know if it is true or not and as we are talking about eternity here it is not something to play around with however i do think this is a poibility and half the time i believe it and the other half i dont so i simply remain undecided  the events at the stable are very significant for a parties concerned for it smed the side aligning themselves with evil are now suenly shocked to s supernatural ouences begin while the animals who are afraid of tashlan are just a the more certain that he is reay angry with them but for the truly saved are hopeful ginger the cat is made into a dumb animal which reay scares the bad side rishda tarkn becomes teified to realise the god he has bn serving actuay does exist emeth rejoices for he wi be able to at long last mt his love which is tash  the children and tirian do not fuy realise what is in the stable but they want to know tirian grabs rishda and goes into the stable with him tirian has a very surprised reaction for the stable is much bier on the inside than it is on the outside this goes into the platonic concept of the inside being bier than the outside and lucy makes the remark that once in her world a stable held someone jesus who was bier than the entire world then the end of narnia comes and every one goes through that stable dr which because of its biblical ausions is a very aroriate dr to have to travel through either you aept jesus or you dont but everyone wi know christ is lord that to me is what the true significance of the stable dr is    this is a brief paper i wrote about how lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper  lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways the four works this eay wi lk at are the lion the witch and the wardrobe prince caspian the voyage of the dawn treader and the last bale not a of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted  in the first bk l we have edmond who has become a traitor edmond does not wish to believe that the witch is bad because she can suly his fix this is one of the biest truths that lewis imparts to his young readers aiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the aiction itself and you wi do anything it takes to get whatever you are aicted t edmond is a claic case of aiction and if this were a work for adults it would have bn quite aropriate to make his aiction drugs when the beavers are discuing aslan edmond does not like the conversation he fls this could pose a threat to geing his fix of turkish delight like drugs this aiction ruins ordinary pleasures and lewis says at the begiing of chapter ix that memories of bad magic fd spoils the taste of regular fd he is so focused on his aictions that edmond no longer cares about real life and he wi do anything poible to get it even seing out his brother and sisters to the white witch which in everyday life could be a man who wi let his family go hungry or wi not pay the rent because he caot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic nds of his family even in this degraded state of mind edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the white witch for what he craves the most she wi not give him for truth to come to edmond he must aept this teible fact of his being a traitor and aslan must die for him aslan and edmond have a talk afterward which although we are not told what is said lewis does te us that edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy  in prince caspian lewis gives us another boy who is struling to discover truth caspian learns from his nurse that there is an older narnia where talking animals lived and there were dwarfs and tr and water people and various creatures who claimed narnia has their home his uncle miraz however denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a dr cornelius who as it turns out is a half brd of dwarf and man it is notable that he is the only named example of interbrding although aording to ford caspians nurse may also have dwarf bld in her caspian must decide which truth he wi believe and because of his relatively gd sense he chses to belief the stories about old narnia this ties into lewiss theme about the longing for the truth i highly doubt that if a person is on aslans side although caspian is not to begin with heshe wi long for something in a dp spiritual sense and it not be the truth lewis talks of this in his pilgrims regre and it is gods prime instrument in conversion people long for something true and unle they are deceived by satan they wi find their answer in jesus christ it is also important to note the relationship betwn dr cornelius and prince caspian god wants to use you to help awake and fd that desire for god in someone elses life and that is why he tes us to go make disciples of men one reason lewis chose dr cornelius as a half brd is to iustrate we are not to perfection yet but we are progreing toward it and also one reason the dwarfs intermaied was so the were not kied sometimes as christians we caot be open about our religion but must sk god to know who we should share it with of course this does not aly to america yet for we have tremendous religious frdom as the world progrees however i fear that wi change once you discover truth then you are aountable to that truth and must help fight for it which prince caspian does and then becomes king caspian  eustace scru also encounters truth for the first time much of the first half of the novel eustace is a perfect a ji also encounters truth in the silver chair at the opening of the novel she learns the aropriate ways to aroach god and these ways are not satanic as the dark magic she suested to eustace as a method of geing into narnia was she also learns in that opening scene with her and aslan more of the nature of god you caot put god in a box and aslan wi make no promises to her what he wi do but she does not doubt his word when the lion tes her that there is no other stream throughout there rest of the novel ji learns that no maer what god says you must do as he asks even if it sms that you wi be kied or seriously harmed or smingly impoible and she also learns that through the giants of harfang god wi take care of you even if you e but there wi be ueceary complictions if you do not do it his way  perhaps the most interesting of a and certainly rather an anomoly as mostly the examples given are gd characters becoming beer but in the last bale we have one of the central bad guys learn that there reay are supernatural forces even though he did not believe in them farsight the eagle notices that rishda tarkn is very surprised about what is in the stable and of shifts destruction his discovery of the truth however is hoific tash the god he has caed on but does not believe has come to gather his lawful prey and rishda is shocked that tash even exists lewis uses this character to iustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke for the worship of tash was a cultural practice that rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture and he reay does not believe in anything  these are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to narnian characters  throughout the years i have wrien a number of reviews that have never bn published online on amazon these writings comprise two types of reviews unfinished reviews

to discover how people produce valuable results and fl gd about themselves but the knowledge most people gain from this bk in reading it is seldom alied this way for example the bk emphasizes giving constructive criticism leing an employ know iediately when she has done something gd or when she has done something wrong and why a close friends manager as an example of a hoor story of misalied principles read an employs writeup of something and wrote an expletive in large red leers acro the text of the writeup but failed to provide any insight as to why he wrote that or why he felt it

mied important details   this bk may be as pivotal to the series as narcius in chains the harlequin which aears to take place in early december probably a wk after danse macabre is about truths and revelations and discoveries masks are ried away and souls are bared new enemies are identified we learn of unexpected new aies menace and danger become more specific and more personal this one bk could easily be the catalyst for several new story lines or new directions in cuent story lines   compared to profeional reviewers im prey sucky at giving formal reviews so i thought instead that i would rather organize my coents in a way thats similar to how i would excitedly te a friend about the harlequin  anita i should first explain my interpretation of anitas ardeur the best analogy i can come up with is when first diagnosed with a chronic medical condition your life is turned upside down youre angry and you want to fight back youre overwhelmed by it consumed by wanting it to go away it sms your life has bn taken over by it but eventuay aeptance comes and dealing with it becomes a part of your day to day life in danse macabre anita finay realized that trying to defeat the ardeur or beat it into submiion wasnt going to work and it wasnt just her life impacted by the ardeur and her response to it in the harlequin we s that by aepting the ardeur as part of her life she no longer must let it rule her life in fact she discovers that the ardeur has nuances she never suspected  of course the ardeur sti neceitates sexual encounters in this bk one encounter serves to reveal some very naked truths excuse the pun one is scary and shocking one is wrien in a way that were able to fl the characters awkwardne about the acts neceity and one is so freakin hot that we like the participants are consumed  now anitas asymptomatic lycanthropy we thats a whole nother ba game its geing a bit crowded in anitas den okay she refers to it as a dark cave but that just sms to give a whole dierent meaning to the point im trying to make and the lycanthropes and vampires arent the only ones that are concerned about it  jeanclaude even though jeanclaude is not physicay present in a prey big chunk of this bk his presence is sti felt in nearly every scene he shows that there can be strength in what on the surface aears to be weakne and events in the harlequin reveal without a doubt who the master is of the ki of the triumvirate and of the entire st louis preternatural counity i know i know cryptic and not very informative but jeanclaude is more action oriented in this bk and i cant coent on his actions without revealing t much of the story  asher asher is not front and center in this bk yet we sti learn some very interesting and potentiay important information about him  micah i was afraid after the revelation in danse macabre of the ardeurs manipulations that we would s doubts in micahs relationship with anita but in the harlequin a doubt about their true flings for each other is removed  we also s that micah has earned respect in the lycanthrope vampire and human counities even albeit grudgingly from richard now thats not to say that micah and richard are suenly bs far from it in fact we get another one of those snark seions betwn the two of them where richard tes him to stop being so perfect i love their snarkine and i have to admit that ive wondered whether those remarks from richard to micah are laures wink and a nod to some of the reader complaints that micah is t perfect  now me i s micah as the character that can best be described as the most true to life man in anitas life he goes to work he takes care of his family hes there when hes nded and he does whatever nds doing hes the one that anita can let down a her defenses with and just simply be a woman loving a man he poees a quiet sort of strength and love that doesnt sk or require the spotlight or drama hes like miions of men whose names and lives wi go uoticed by everyone but his friends or family but to them hes a true hero  although my real life may color my perceptions of micah ive bn maied to someone very much like him for nearly 25 years theyre the kind of men you can go the distance with  nathaniel i nd to preface this by explaining my flings about nathaniel i dont dislike him i just am not aached to him ive yet to coect with him ive just never thought of him as a permanent character like anita jeanclaude richard or micah in my mind hes more than a secondary character but not quite a main character hes easily dismied by me gd grief i sound like richard dont i after he steed up to the plate in danse macabre and now the harlequin i find him le easily dismied sti not quite permanent but not as temporary either i have no doubt that he loves anita and she loves him but particularly after some revelations in the harlequin im just not sure what flavor of love exists betwn them anita even refers to micah and nathaniels reaction to her pregnancy scare in what to me is a revealing way instead of saying that they were ready to step up to the plate and be daies she says they were ready to be day and nay so my interpretation is that even anita may not s nathanial as one of the heavyweights  when we first met nathaniel it was tough for me to get past his mkne his dismial of himself and the fact that he was just so damn young i just didnt and sti dont have a point of reference to understand him i prey much had to ignore his age completely and make him older in my head what has made that even more neceary is that he is now 20 years old and because of bk chronology versus real life chronology my oldest son and daughter are now the same age k so i think i have to leave the interpretations of nathaniel in the harlequin to those readers that do coect with him and i know there are a lot of you i sti have to make him older in my head which is more diicult to do with this bk and i know im not capable of forming a fair aement of him or his actions  richard richard is sti one of the most amazingly complex characters ive ever met i adore him even though he pies me o he tears my heart out he frustrates me he is trying to get his head together but with richard it sms like for every step forward he takes thr steps back going back to the analogy of a chronic medical condition richard unlike anita is sti at the stage of not aepting that his life is now changed permanently of sti being angry that this lycanthropy has haened to him and neceitated a profound change in his life and his perceptions of himself the why me i dont want this stage aing to his conflicts part of him embraces and revels in his new life but he just cant sm to let go of his original visions of the future he always aumed hed have and he cant create a new whole richard until he aepts his new reality  many of the most important revelations in this bk are richards some so painful that i felt like i had bn punched in the gut i actuay found myself cringing and thinking no richard dont do it through both his actions and his words he reveals some truths so profound that im not sure if now that the poison has bn ried from his wounds whether healing can now begin or whether the wounds wi remain raw and bldy only laure knows although i suspect that even she wont reay know for sure until her characters te her  jason jason is a bit wraed up with his new girlfriend and so isnt on stage except for a brief but emotional scene btw i cant remember if this was ever revealed before but jason is wolf because of raina  edward edward finay learns the truth about anitas cuent life but ever practical he gathers information from several sources digests it then procds to deal with its eects on his cuent objectives we do get glimpses of the eect that doa and her kids have had on him very interesting glimpses and yes as laure said in her blogs peter does come to st louis with him and its a very dierent peter than we saw in obsidian buerfly  olaf yep as laure said at some signings olaf and edward had a deal olaf would stay away from anita so long as edward promised to bring him in as backup the next time anita nded it lets just say that olafs parting gift to anita by the end of the harlequin is a new recuing nightmare shuer  bee morte crpy scary unpredictable fortunately for everyone she doesnt spend t much time visiting anita in this bk nu said  marm noir mother of a darknemoy dearest scary revelations a specific threat arises because she knows that the anitajean clauderichard triumvirate has not exchanged the fourth mark oh and lets just say that im prey sure anita hopes marm noir never pus her name in the christmas gift exchange  theres also a revelation so profound that i whispered a gasping oh sh we now know why moy dearest is waking up truly a gasp worthy moment  at the las vegas signing for danse macabre last year laure said that there is someone else out there like anita but we havent met him because anita is not aware of him yet i just hope that when she does mt him that he turns out to be an ay shes going to nd a the help she can get  malcolmive gained a whole dierent perspective on him a complete 360 in how i view him his motives and his objectives  the deaths soy but no i am s not saying who dies i wi say that the death that laure bloed about the one that eected her so much does cause grief in the characters t interesting though that while the other characters truly mourn that death it is another death that eected me more although i suspect it was more emotionay wrenching for me because it was colored by people in my real life  the pard chey does have some scenes in this bk but unfortunately we dont catch up with the rest of the pard  they are mentioned as a group though  the ki the wererats the hyenas the swans the lions the wolves and others members of a have important placement in the harlequin  i think that covers everyone one final coent the very last paragraph in the bk opens the dr to

choy in many parts one is not sure where he is going with his aorted findings of references to screws through the ages he jumps around back and forth delving in the 17s then the mile ages then the 18s then roman times then to the 15sits quite confusing to foow the thread if there is one i dont think the author tk the time to reflect on a he had found and te a clear story of it rather he revels understandably in the fun and frustrations of researching the material  his aertion that the inventor of the screw was clearly a mathematical genius is not very convincing yes the helix is elegant but as his evidence makes clear the screw probably started out as an ancient very simple and crude tl and evolved from there just because some mathematicians like hero describe it mathematicay doesnt mean he invented it it may not even be aurate to say the screw was inventedafter a the shape of the screw is found in nature there is just a history of increasingly inventive and optimized uses of its shape  the author did provide enough information for me to observe that that the evolution of using screws sms to have gone through thr main phases  in the first phase it was used as the primary part of a large tl such as a method of moving water or lifting heavy objects they were often crude and made out of basic natural materials  the second phase saw screws being made smaer and being integrated not as fastners but as parts of more complex tls such as lathes as we as toys weapons and watches where the screw help proper other parts these required more precise screws made of separately manufactured materials such as metal aoys  the third phase saw screws being used not to move things but as as stationary fasteners here it would have bn particularly interesting to read more about why manufactuers chose to use screws vs rivets nails or other fasteners depending on the dierent alications and materials to be fastened but the autor does an interesting job exploring the evolution of screw head types such as flathead phiips and square socket also once screws began to be used as fastners the chaenge of manufacturing them smed to go from inventing ways to make them smaer more precise and more durable to manufacturing them faster to fd everincreasing numbers of aembly lines construction workers handymen craftsmen hoyists and doityourselfers  one could also say that perhaps screws have entered yet another phase as being objects of art and history the use of the term in english vocabularly has certainly evolved colorfuy  these phases overlap overtime and continue in tandem in each of these phases one could have logicay subdivided information about how they are used in each scenario tl part fasteners art etc their specific design features how they were made and

examining this machinery of exchange braudel also proposed an ambitious thesis concerning the origins of capitalismthe bk itself is a monumental work an impreive combination of statistical analyses and iustrations from primary sources  braudels first two chapters the instruments of exchange and markets and the economy investigated the role of circulationin chapter one he concentrated on the

tied up in equipment and other items while the circulating capital was more liquid and included wagesbraudel also investigated the role of land in production and capitalism noting the great landowner

opulent families one family from the industrial north the other from the plantation south coence their turbulent friendship at west point and climaxes on april 12 1861 when confederate soldiers led by brigadier general beauregard opened fire on unionheld fort sumter in charleston south carolina marking the onset of a bldy american civil war which claimed over 620 lives more than a the wars in

in this opening instament albeit with some wear and tear i actuay wanted charles main to die i didnt necearily like the decidedly southern focus of the novel or some of the soapoperaish melodramatic fictional ploing which just prompted questions of idiocy towards some of the characters half the time i felt like i was reading a more intense version of the 80s tv serials daas or falcon crest about rich families you remember those dont you  i thought north and south skifuy portrayed the factual events politics and fervid extremist views on both sides which embroil this conflict jakes convincingly iustrates how a sectional storm of extremist malevolence could wipe away reason and gd intentions personal ambitions and desires drive much of the extremist views antislavery antagonistic northern views sms to put the south on the defensive and jakes magnificently captures how even reasonable men from the south against slavery fight for the south because of prevalently generalized antisouthern sentiments the bk conveys many factual legislation people politics writers and authors during this time period a of which widens the sectional schism and races the country to an ueceary yet imperative conflict the paradox that jakes speaks of in his afterword jakes deftly realizes west point its cadets and its cuiculum an academy which produces most if not a the briiant civil war oicers on both sides the bk adeptly highlights the contrasting economies betwn the industrial north and the agricultural south an economic contrast symbolized by the very aearance of our fictional

two families and representing the potential for love betwn north and south during a time of turmoil and conflict  you might think a novel about the american civil war would focus more on the north right not so in this opening instament i thought jakes skews the bulk of the perspective from the south and the southern family mains the mains are a lot more fleshed out tiet main the father both his sons cper and oy and both his daughters ashton and bre id be remi not to mention tiets nephew and oys cousin the reckle yet incredibly handsome charles main whose adventures and character development probably outshine that of any other character in terms of shr page count his early reckle brawling and whoring ways his development into a gentleman when he prepares for a duel with a smith and finay his leadership as a soldier after hes stationed at texas by contrast the northern pesylvania industrialists the hazards receive at best a perfunctory treatment the patriarch wiiam hazard perishes in the first part of the novel stanley the eldest son isnt nearly as interesting as cper main and consequently doesnt receive nearly as much aention oys perspective and love story easily overshadows george hazards oy and george are the two second sons who mt and become friends at west point in 1842 remember cousin charles mains character development and adventures eclipses biy hazards the youngest hazard brother and for that maer eclipses that of every other character as we and of course ashton and bre main are far more evident than the irksome fanatic hazard daughter virgilia furthermore oys love interest madeline lamoe is a lot more fleshed out than george hazards love interest constance  although i enjoyed charles characterization in the very begiing as a reckle 7 yearold boy i reay disliked him the more he grew and the more the bk focused on him for instance north and south spent a smingly pointle 7 chapters over 60 pages exclusively on charles adventures in texas with the pernicious captain bent i found the entire ordeal with charles and bent in texas pointle and exhausting even portions at the end smingly about biy hazard and bre involved charles as he flies to the rescue at a ried duel betwn biy hazard and forbes lamoe  i also found much of the fictional ploing involving these two families ridiculous convoluted and t soapy it just smed like these

finay he reaches gwyntystorm only to find the place is overrun with couption and a sinister plot against the king  however there are several things that bothered me throughout the course of the story

myth to arthurian folklore to lord of the rings  secondly is the myriad of plot devices that he brings into the story only to completely ignore later on this includes the aforementioned white birds but this is a minor oasion that is easily forgoen more crucial is the character of lina and the other creatures who are hinted to be transformed humans atoning for their sins but their development

places upon them but for me it felt as though an almost sadistic pleasure was taken in teifying and destroying these people a man whose nose is bien a the way through women and children are scared

indebted to macdonalds iovative fairytales and it can be safely said that both the lord of the rings and the chronicles of narnia are direct descendants of macdonalds work from these two original fairytales tolkien boowed the idea of the goblininfested mountain which arose in his own work as the mines of moria whilst lewis adopted macdonalds trend of investing magic and enchantment with christian images and themes  the prince and the goblin centres around two young protagonists the young prince irene pronounced with thr syables i  rn  n and the slightly older curdie a boy who mines in the mountains they live close to each other without knowing it as irene has grown up on a castle by the mountainside away from her father and his court whilst curdie lives with his parents in a simple coage near the mine shafts  on a rainy afternn when the prince is bored she explores the old castle and discovers a magical rm at the top of the house where her greatgreatgreat grandmother

that live above ground only together are the two children able to defeat their foes  also worth noting is macdonalds treatment of female characters throughout the bk although the nursemaid ltie is a stereotypical mother hen both the prince irene and her greatgrandmother are strong female characters  rare for a bk first published in 1872 it is irene who is charged with the task of rescuing curdie from the clutches of the goblins rather than the other way around leading her through the darkne of the subteanean caves guided by a single golden thread symbolic of faith even more thoughtprovoking is her greatgrandmother who represents the divine within the story other bks such as the aforementioned lord of the rings and chronicles of narnia and many more besides solely have male figures as their heavenly figures and is a coon theme in later fantasy bks for powerful spiritual females to have a mother nature or mystical fl to them here however macdonald presents the angelic spirit in the

be a case that things have bn down so long it lks like up to me boom line is that i found the harlequin to be the best anita blake novel in yearswe also have the nice lile irony that in this novel she actuay lives up to her title of being a vampire hunter which has rarely bn the case in the series  in virtuay every novel our heroine manifests a new power from the ability to raise an entire graveyard of corpses to forming her own triumvirate with damien as her vampire and nathaniel as her beast to ca which makes the main triumvirate with jeanclaude and richard even more powerfulnow jeanclaude has his own bldline and in the world of vampire politics this is a seismic event and back in the old country the vampire council is taking notice of what is haening in st louisas the harlequin begins and this time the title refers to people rather than a place somebody is aarently doing something about it and the threat is so bad that if jeanclaude tes anita about it they are a going to diefortunately anita trusts jeanclaude we enough that she is wiing to take his word even though it cuts against her grain not to make her own decisionsthere might not be any sex during the first fiftn chapters but they sure talk about it a lot for people who should be at defcon 5 soy i sti think in cold war terms this century i should be saying code red using the homeland security advisory systemonce the harlequin masks start showing up staying alive is the only thing that maers and sundry reasons for geing into anitas bed should not even be close to being secondary concerns  my complaint about a the sex is qualitative as we as quantitative in that since it tk several bks for anita to finay chse betwn jeanclaude and richard that first sex scene in jeanclaudes bath tub was ultra hot and it has a bn downhi from therethe sex scenes in the harlequin are relatively few short and to the point there is way more talking about sex than having sex this time around and while it is a welcome change and the discourse often touches as much on the vampire politics involved as it does on anitas flings it does slow down the action a bit which maers since they are in the mile of a major crisisi understand that at this point anita blake has to have sex to fd the ardeur the way jeanclaude has to drink bld and richard nds to bitch and moan so any novel that takes place in more than one day is going to have to have a sex scenebut if the harlequin are coming to get you i think discuions about whether anita can give nathaniel what he nds when it comes to being dominated during sex can wait until the crisis is pastanita was always a talker and part of the problem is that she has so much more to talk about these days although she actuay manages to put o several conversations in this story believe it or notsti on balance things are a lot beer in this latest novel in terms of the sex as far as i am concerned  after a the sex stu my biest complaint about recent novels would be that the climax so to speak almost always involves anita puing a new power out of a hat although at this point i have to admit there are so many dimensions to her power that i am having trouble distinguishing betwn the old ones and the new onesi know that it a has to do with anita being a necromancer and that whatever she is going to be when a is said and done she is not there

novel danse macabre this time we actuay get to the payo and things hit the fanbecause the end game involves what could be a welcome change in the ardeur and a moment that has bn a long time coming
